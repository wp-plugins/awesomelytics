Pulls in the required files for Awesomelytics cross-site real-time and historical web analytics for websites.

== Description ==
Awesomelytics provides standard web analytics features — view detailed visitor information in real time on a world map, analyze historical information on visits, record events, and so on — but what distinguishes Awesomelytics from other analytics platforms is cross-site analytics.

If, say, you run Alice's Airplanes, Bob's Bicycles, and Charlie's Cars, then you can set up logic like this when someone visits Alice's Airplanes:

1. If the user hasn't visited Charlie's Cars, show them a promo banner for Charlie's Cars.
1. If the user has visited Charlie's Cars but hasn't visited Bob's Bicycles, show them a promo banner for Bob's Bicycles.
1. If the user has already visited both Bob's Bicycles and Charlie's Cars, show them a discount banner for Alice's Airplanes.

Or, if the visitor has entered their income information at any of the three sites, market bicycles, cars, or airplanes (as appropriate to their income) at each of the three sites.

Or, you can prepopulate a registration form with their name and email gleaned from another of your sites.
